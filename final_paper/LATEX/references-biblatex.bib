  abstract = {Abstract             Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools hold significant promises for enhancing teaching and learning outcomes in higher education. However, continues usage behavior and satisfaction of educators with GenAI systems are still less explored. Therefore, this study aims to identify factors influencing academic staff satisfaction and continuous GenAI usage in higher education, employing a survey method and analyzing data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). This research utilized the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) as its theoretical foundations, while also integrating ethical concerns as a significant factor. Data was collected from a sample of 127 university academic staff through an online survey questionnaire. The study found a positive correlation between effort expectancy, ethical consideration, expectation confirmation, and academic staff satisfaction. However, performance expectancy did not show a positive correlation with satisfaction. Performance expectancy was positively related to the intention to use GenAI tools, while academic staff satisfaction positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The social influence did not correlate positively with the use of GenAI. Security and privacy were positively associated with staff satisfaction. Facilitation conditions also positively influenced the intention to use GenAI. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for academia and policymakers, guiding the responsible integration of GenAI tools in education while emphasizing factors for policy considerations and developers of GenAI tools.},

  abstract = {The teaching of artificial intelligence (AI) topics in school curricula is an important global strategic initiative in educating the next generation. As AI technologies are new to K-12 schools, there is a lack of studies that inform schools’ teachers about AI curriculum design. How to prepare and engage teachers, and which approaches are suitable for planning the curriculum for sustainable development, are unclear. Therefore, this case study aimed to explore the views of teachers with and without AI teaching experience on key considerations for the preparation, implementation and continuous refinement of a formal AI curriculum for K-12 schools. It drew on the self-determination theory (SDT) and four basic curriculum planning approaches—content, product, process and praxis—as theoretical frameworks to explain the research problems and findings. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 teachers—twelve with and twelve without experience in teaching AI—and used thematic analysis to analyze the interview data. Our findings revealed that genuine curriculum creation should encompass all four forms of curriculum design approach that are coordinated by teachers’ self-determination to be orchestrators of student learning experiences. This study also proposed a curriculum development cycle for teachers and curriculum officers.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, technological advancements, especially artificial intelligence (AI), have significantly transformed educational practices. Recently, the development and adoption of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), particularly OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has sparked considerable interest. The unprecedented capabilities of these models, such as generating humanlike text and facilitating automated conversations, have broad implications in various sectors, including education and health. Despite their immense potential, concerns regarding their widespread use and opacity have been raised within the scientific community. ChatGPT, the latest version of the GPT series, has displayed remarkable proficiency, passed the US bar law exam, and amassed over a million subscribers shortly after its launch. However, its impact on the education sector has elicited mixed reactions, with some educators heralding it as a progressive step and others raising alarms over its potential to reduce analytical skills and promote misconduct. This paper aims to delve into these discussions, exploring the potential and problems associated with applying advanced AI models in education. It builds on extant literature and contributes to understanding how these technologies reshape educational norms in the “new AI gold rush” era.},

  abstract = {Introduction               This study evaluated the usability and effectiveness of an artificial intelligence Braille Tutor designed to supplement the instruction of students with visual impairments as they learned to write braille contractions.                                         Methods               A mixed-methods design was used, which incorporated a single-subject, adapted alternating treatments design as well as qualitative teacher interviews and surveys.                                         Results               Students seemed to reach 100\% accuracy faster when using Braille Tutor (average = 7.0 sessions; range 1.0 to 12.0 sessions) than when they did not (average 9.6 sessions with a teacher of students with visual impairments; range 3.0 to 16.0 sessions). Also, students who used Braille Tutor more often tended to learn more contractions overall during the study (average = 21.25; range 13.0 to 30.0) than students who used it less (average 9.0; range 9.0 to 9.0).                                         Discussion               The first trend noted was that students in the teacher of students with visual impairments plus Braille Tutor phase (hereafter, TVI+Tutor) tended to learn contractions more quickly. A second trend surfaced: The students in the TVI+Tutor phase tended to get more frequent reinforcement as opposed to students in the TVI Only phase. A third trend was noted: Students in the TVI+Tutor phase saw a quicker initial jump and tended to be more consistent in that initial jump. Although the prototype version of Braille Tutor in this study needs further development to broaden its capabilities, some students found its use highly motivating.                                         Implications for practitioners               Although there is strong evidence that advanced technologies are not suitable replacements for braille literacy instruction, technology can be used along with quality instruction by a teacher of visually impaired students to enhance proficiency in braille literacy.},

  abstract = {This study is centered on investigating the acceptance and utilization of AI Chatbot technology among graduate students in China and its implications for higher education. Employing a fusion of the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model and the ECM (Expectation-Confirmation Model), the research seeks to pinpoint the pivotal factors influencing students’ attitudes, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions regarding AI Chatbots. The study constructs a model comprising seven substantial predictors aimed at precisely foreseeing users’ intentions and behavior with AI Chatbots. Collected from 373 students enrolled in various universities across China, the self-reported data is subject to analysis using the partial-least squares method of structural equation modeling to confirm the model’s reliability and validity. The findings validate seven out of the eleven proposed hypotheses, underscoring the influential role of ECM constructs, particularly “Confirmation” and “Satisfaction,” outweighing the impact of UTAUT constructs on users’ behavior. Specifically, users’ perceived confirmation significantly influences their satisfaction and subsequent intention to continue using AI Chatbots. Additionally, “Personal innovativeness” emerges as a critical determinant shaping users’ behavioral intention. This research emphasizes the need for further exploration of AI tool adoption in educational settings and encourages continued investigation of their potential in teaching and learning environments.},
